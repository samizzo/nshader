MPLEX Summary
=============================================================================
Total number of states = 75, total accept states = 60, backup states = 8
Automaton will cater for left-anchored patterns
Original state number was 103, minimized machine has 75 states
Compression summary: used 365 nextstate entries, plus 126 map entries
- Uncompressed automaton would have 4 915 200 nextstate entries
- Input characters are packed into 35 equivalence classes
- CharClass compression 99,95%, 35 entries Vs 65 536
- Nextstate table compression 86,10%, 365 entries Vs 2 625
- CharacterMap compression is 99,81%, 126 entries Vs 65 536
- Decision tree depth is 1
